Re creating the bitmap logic simulator, original simulator:
https://realhet.wordpress.com/2015/09/02/bitmap-logic-simulator/
he wrote it in lua (i think) i'm rewriting it in c++ using SFML
i don't have (or don't know where to get) his source code
so i think it will be a chalanging task
here it goes

His software helped me to understand how computers work, but its been a year since i switched entierly to linux but his software only runs on windows, although it runs on [Wine], AND i wanted to write my own AND i wanted a faster one (he also wanted a faster one)


you can simply [cmake .] and then [make] to get your executable

This is a codelite project, you can open it in codelite and then you can right click the project there in [Custom Targets] you will find debug and release cmakes, after that you can [Build]
